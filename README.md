# Scroller Demo - 80s and 90s Style with SDL

## Description

This is a Scroller Demo inspired by the 80s and 90s style of the C64, but implemented using the SDL library in C. 
At the moment, the demo can be compiled on Linux machines using `make`. Windows Microsoft Visual Studio integration
is still experimental. Feel free to go further in this direction. The demo relies on the following SDL2 libraries:

- SDL
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_image
- SDL_mixer

Extensions and contributions are always welcome.

The font used in this demo is "StripeCaps" by "House of Lime," and it is free for personal use. 
You can find it [here](https://blogfonts.com/stripes-caps.font) or download it from [Fontspace](https://www.fontspace.com/get/family/2333d).  
I thank the author for her wonderful masterpiece and her open source spirit providing her art work 
for non commerical use.
